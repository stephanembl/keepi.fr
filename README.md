Every Epitech fourth-year student has to go study abroad for a year.

KeePi.fr is a new blogging platform designed to gather Epitech's fourth-year students all over the world.

The main goals are to:
 - Help classmates stay easily in touch no matter the distance
 - Share this once-in-a-lifetime experience with friends and family via a complete set of tools
 - Give future fourth-year students an insight of their future destination

KeePi is a work in progress and is not opened to public yet.
